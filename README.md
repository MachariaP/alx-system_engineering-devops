# System Engineering & DevOps Module at ALX

This repository represents the projects undertaken during the System Engineering and DevOps module as part of the Full Stack Software Engineering studies at [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/).

## [Projects](https://github.com/MachariaP/alx-system_engineering-devops#projects)

Below is an overview of the projects completed during the course:

### [0x00-shell_basics](https://github.com/MachariaP/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x00-shell_basics)

This project introduces fundamental commands, navigation, and file manipulation in the Shell environment. Mastery of these basics is essential for efficient interaction with Unix-like operating systems.

### [0x01-shell_permissions](https://github.com/MachariaP/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x01-shell_permissions)

In this project, we explore man pages and delve into understanding permissions (owner, group, and others) of files and directories in the Shell. Proper permission management is foundational for securing systems.

### [0x02-shell_redirections](https://github.com/MachariaP/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x02-shell_redirections)

This project focuses on handling standard input and output, combining commands and filters with redirections in the Shell. Redirections are powerful tools for manipulating command input and output streams.

### [0x03-shell_variable_expansions](https://github.com/MachariaP/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions)

Topics covered include alias built-ins, help built-ins, local, global, and reserved variables (PATH, HOME, and PS1), special parameters `$?`, and single and double quotes in Shell. Understanding variable expansions is crucial for effective scripting and automation.

### [0x14-mysql](https://github.com/MachariaP/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x14-mysql)

This module delves into incorporating the use of MySQL in system engineering and DevOps practices. It includes topics such as database management, querying, and the integration of MySQL into a system architecture.

### [0x15-api](https://github.com/MachariaP/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x15-api)

The project explores the integration and use of APIs within the system engineering and DevOps context. This includes understanding how to interact with external services through API calls and incorporating them into a broader system architecture.

### [Command Line For The Win](https://github.com/MachariaP/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/command_line_for_the_win)

This project aims to enhance mastery of command-line commands across different difficulty levels. It involves solving real-world challenges using command-line tools, reinforcing practical skills.
